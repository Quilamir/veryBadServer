what is the main issue that is causing the server to return errors?






how will you refactor the server to make sure it will not return errors in these scnarios: 

	a. you have no additional resources other than the original server (assume the server spec is the same as your laptop) 





	b. there is no time limit for the server response 






	c. you have any additional resources you want to make the system run as fast and handle as many requests as possible
